And Stephanie Alexander -

195
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:58,200
two missed calls.

196
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:00,880
I don't think there's a place

197
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:00,880
for a community garden.

198
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:02,240
There must be somewhere

199
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:04,440
we can squeeze in

200
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:04,440
a couple of tomato plants.

201
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,560
(SIGHS) Maybe I...

202
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:09,520
I tell you what -

203
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:09,520
I'll leave it with you.

204
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,560
I can't even bring myself

205
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,560
to look at it.

206
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,480
Rhonda, I just hung up

207
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,480
on a federal minister.

208
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:17,480
Good, because we need to

209
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:17,480
get on top of this.

210
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:19,920
We're nation-builders.

211
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:19,920
For God's sake!

212
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:22,320
It looks like we're still

213
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:22,320
building the Snowy.

214
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:23,960
-What's wrong with it?

215
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:23,960
-Everything!

216
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,560
The font, the colours.

217
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,560
Tell me one thing it does well.

218
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,240
-It says who we are.

219
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,240
-Disagree.

220
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:30,160
-It doesn't speak to me.

221
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:30,160
-It's a logo.

222
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:32,000
I deal with a lot of

223
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:32,000
departments,

224
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:35,120
and this is the sort of thing

225
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:35,120
everyone's getting right,

226
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:39,040
whereas I look at this,

227
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:39,040
and what do I hear?

228
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:40,760
Nothing.

229
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,760
-What do you want it to say?

230
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,760
-"Hey, you!"

231
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,800
"Get excited, get ready,

232
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:46,960
"because Australia's

233
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:46,960
being built!"

234
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,880
OK, well, I'll take that...

235
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:52,320
"So get out of the way,

236
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:52,320
because the future's now. Bang!"

237
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:54,360
-OK. You done?

238
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:54,360
-Bang.

239
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,720
OK, well, I'll make a note

240
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,720
to think about it.

241
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:59,200
-No, we need to jump on this.

242
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:59,200
-Yep. Sure. Definitely.

243
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:00,840
-Yes?

244
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:00,840
-That minister phoned back.

245
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,840
Oh, great.

246
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,840
What line is she on?

247
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:06,000
No, I told her you were busy.

248
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:06,000
And I didn't quite get her name.

249
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:08,000
-I know her name.

250
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:08,000
-Phew! (LAUGHS)

251
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:10,920
-Can you get her back online?

252
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:10,920
-She would have boarded by now.

253
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,400
HUGH: We could put it here.

254
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:16,040
-That's a roundabout.

255
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:16,040
-Sorry, I just saw green.

256
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:18,200
-In front of the apartments?

257
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:18,200
-No, that's the promenade.

258
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,880
What about behind?

259
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,520
I think that puts it

260
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,520
in the shade.

261
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:23,160
-So?

262
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:23,160
-What would you grow?

263
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,480
Mushrooms?

264
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:26,480
What about here?

265
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:29,000
Uh, that is a car park.

266
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:31,360
Put the car park underground

267
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:31,360
and the gardens on top.

268
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:34,480
-It's a little expensive. -Then

269
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:34,480
put the gardens underground.

270
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:35,960
-In order to grow what?

271
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:35,960
-Mushrooms.

272
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,320
-Can we forget about mushrooms?

273
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,320
-Truffles.

274
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:40,680
-What about here?

275
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:40,680
-What is it?

276
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:43,760
-It's green.

277
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:43,760
-It's not a roundabout.

278
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:46,960
-Thanks for joining us...

279
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:46,960
-Joining us now with details...

280
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,560
MAN: The gardens are

281
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,560
offering local residents...

282
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,080
WOMAN: It's a vibrant

283
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,080
community garden.

284
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,760
WOMAN 2: ..a community garden

285
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,760
project that's different...

286
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,640
WOMAN 3: ..gardening's

287
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,640
a bit old-fashioned...

288
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,960
-Privileged to be part of it.

289
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,960
-The backyard of the future.

290
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,800
MAN 2: We need the rain, true,

291
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,840
but you need to keep

292
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,840
the topsoil, don't you?

293
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:01,600
Yeah. No, that was

294
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:01,600
loud and clear.

295
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:03,480
Yes, no, that was

296
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:03,480
loud and clear as well.

297
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:06,840
Sorry, if I could just...

298
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:06,840
Hello? Hello?

299
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,920
How's it going?

300
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:12,040
-Uh, good. Yeah, just spoke

301
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:12,040
to Garry Bennett. -Oh, great.

302
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,760
-The property developer for the

303
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,760
Woolarong... -I know who he is.

304
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,240
And I told him about

305
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,240
the community garden.

306
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:19,560
Yep. What did he say?

307
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,240
Want it with or without

308
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,240
the swearwords?

309
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:22,560
Without.

310
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,600
Uh, point one.

311
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:26,520
"It's the dumbest beeping idea

312
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:26,520
I've ever heard."

313
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:30,960
Two. "Tell her she's beeping

314
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:30,960
crazy." I think that's you.

315
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,800
"Listen, you beeping redheaded

316
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,800
twerp" - I think that's me -

317
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:37,360
"why would people buying

318
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:37,360
luxury beeping penthouses

319
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:39,920
"want to grow

320
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:39,920
a beeping lettuce?"

321
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:42,040
And then he became really angry.

322
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,720
Right.

323
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,680
-Karnsten?

324
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,680
-Karsten!

325
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,640
-Karnsten.

326
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,640
-Karsten.

327
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:50,520
Oh, sorry.

328
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:50,520
We did meet before, didn't we?

329
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,320
Karlsten's here. Yep.

330
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,880
-Tony?

331
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,880
-Yep?

332
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,720
Karnsten's here

333
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,720
for Rhonda's logo meeting.

334
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:58,280
Oh, no. Can Scotty do it?

335
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:58,280
I'm not in.

336
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:00,560
-But you are.

337
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:00,560
-But he doesn't know that.

338
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,360
Um, he does.

339
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,680
I should check these things,

340
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,680
shouldn't I?

341
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,480
-Yeah. Let's make this

342
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,480
really quick. -Gotcha.

343
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:08,800
Actually, if I'm not back in 10,

344
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:08,800
come and get me.

345
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:10,560
What do I say?

346
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,600
Say there's an urgent

347
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,600
phone call, something like that.

348
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:14,320
OK, got it. Gotcha.

349
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:16,280
Oh, and that minister

350
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:16,280
from the other day rang back.

351
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:18,080
Why didn't you

352
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:18,080
come and tell me?

353
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:20,360
You were in a meeting

354
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:20,360
with Scotty. I got her name.

355
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,800
I know her name!

356
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,800
In future, come and tell me.

357
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:25,440
Right. But check

358
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:25,440
if you're in first.

359
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:27,160
-Karsten.

360
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:27,160
-Tony!

361
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:28,600
-Welcome back.

362
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:28,600
-Scotty.

363
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:30,720
-All done?

364
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:30,720
-How good are these?

365
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:33,200
Tony, I know how you like to

366
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:33,200
get these things really moving,

367
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:35,640
so I've got them all set up

368
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:35,640
and ready to go.

369
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:38,360
So this should not take

370
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:38,360
more than an hour or two.

371
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,240
Right, I'll stop you there.

372
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,240
I like that one.

373
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:42,280
-I don't. -I do.

374
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:42,280
-None of these are ours.

375
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:44,400
-Sorry? -They're copyrighted.

376
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:44,400
-Can't we change it a little?

377
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:46,520
I think

378
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:46,520
that's a bit dangerous.

379
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,600
Mmm, sounds dangerous.

380
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,600
We're trying to make a decision.

381
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:52,040
-Are those ours?

382
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:52,040
-I will get to these.

383
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:54,320
-I like that one.

384
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:54,320
-Tony, if you wanna take a seat.

385
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:57,080
Yeah, it speaks to me. It says

386
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:57,080
all the things I need to hear.

387
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,360
-"Bam! Hey, you!"

388
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,360
-No, I'm not hearing that.

389
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:01,200
Quick decision?

390
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:04,520
OK, well, just take a seat

391
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:04,520
and we'll...

392
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,720
Alright. If I get called away,

393
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,720
that one.

394
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,280
You fucking idiots.

395
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:24,920
It was added by someone

396
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:24,920
in another office.

397
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,720
-Bit of a blip.

398
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,720
-This is no blip.

399
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:28,640
-Then it's a hiccup.

400
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:28,640
-What were they thinking?

401
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:31,240
They were hoping a small garden

402
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:31,240
might add a village feel.

403
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:33,040
-Village?!

404
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:33,040
-Sort of an added feature.

405
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,920
Have you seen our apartments?

406
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:37,640
Do they look like they wanna be

407
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:37,640
growing tomatoes?

408
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:40,880
Uh, lemons, maybe?

409
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:40,880
Or limes, for the cocktails?

410
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:43,400
-Modern, elegant,

411
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:43,400
inner-urban chic. -Yeah.

412
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,480
And you wanna put a compost heap

413
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,480
in the middle.

414
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:47,360
Or round the back,

415
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:47,360
depending on shade.

416
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:50,000
-You're fucking kidding me.

417
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:50,000
-It wouldn't have to be large.

418
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:52,400
-Inner-urban chic.

419
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:52,400
-Gotcha.

420
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:55,120
-Good. -But if we found

421
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:55,120
the right location...

422
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:56,560
Listen, the only vegetables

423
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,720
I wanna see within a half-mile

424
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,720
of my apartments

425
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:01,120
are gonna be sitting on

426
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:01,120
the shelf of the IGA, got it?

427
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:04,720
You clueless

428
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:04,720
work-experience clowns.

429
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:06,960
I think that was point four.

430
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:11,120
Whereas this one

431
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:11,120
really speaks to the future.

432
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:14,600
You know, elements of

433
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:14,600
building and construction.

434
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,760
It's very...it's very bold.

435
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,960
-Um, Tony?

436
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,960
-Yes?

437
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,200
I was just saying that this one

438
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,200
speaks to the future.

439
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:23,480
Yeah, I hear that.

440
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:23,480
But they're all so good.

441
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:26,160
Maybe we should just

442
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:26,160
go through them one more time.

443
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:28,760
-KARSTEN: Good idea.

444
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:28,760
-Tony, sorry to interrupt.

445
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:32,040
-Phone call for you.

446
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:32,040
-Oh, OK. Is it urgent?

447
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,960
Yes, yes. It's urgent.

448
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,920
-Who is it?

449
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,920
-Um...

450
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:38,480
-That company?

451
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:38,480
-Why don't I speak to them?

452
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:40,480
No, no,

453
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:40,480
I'd better speak to them.

454
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:42,600
-Which company was it?

455
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:42,600
-Um...

456
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,080
-But it's urgent?

457
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,080
-Yes!

458
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:45,720
Why don't you take it

459
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:45,720
in here, then?

460
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,760
-Great idea, Karsten.

461
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,760
-It's absolutely fine.

462
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:50,760
I will wait outside. It sounds

463
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:50,760
important. I'll wait outside.

464
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:53,240
L'extérieur.

465
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:55,080
I should have thought of

466
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:55,080
a name, shouldn't I?

467
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:58,240
Oh, is this related to the...

468
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:58,240
Ooh! You fooled me!

469
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:00,280
Can he see me?

470
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,720
-Yep.

471
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,720
-OK.

472
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,680
Let's finish this meeting asap.

473
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:05,680
And, Scotty,

474
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:05,680
you ride shotgun on it.

475
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:08,040
This organisation is on

476
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:08,040
the verge of an investment coup

477
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,800
and we're currently

478
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,800
redesigning logos!

479
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:12,040
Are you speaking to me

480
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:12,040
or the person on the phone?

481
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:14,400
-Person on the phone is fake!

482
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:14,400
-Ah, fooled me again!

483
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:16,800
-I need you to keep a lid

484
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:16,800
on this bullshit. -Got it.

485
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:19,040
OK, let's get him back in,

486
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:19,040
knock this on the head.

487
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:22,000
-I'm on a plane in three hours.

488
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:22,000
-Oh, yeah? On a plane.

489
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:23,800
-No, a real one.

490
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:23,800
-Got me again.

491
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:25,280
WOMAN: 6:07.

492
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:25,280
Thanks for joining us...

493
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:27,520
MAN: These gardens are a great

494
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:27,520
way for residents to meet...

495
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:29,440
WOMAN 2: About time developers

496
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:29,440
thought about the community.

497
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:31,880
WOMAN 3: It's like that Jamie

498
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:31,880
Oliver thing where you teach...

499
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:33,560
MAN 2: Everyone should

500
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:33,560
have their own garden,

501
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,320
even if you live

502
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,320
in an apartment.

503
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,600
-It's good for everyone.

504
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,600
-Put people ahead of profit.

505
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:40,360
-What's that?

506
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:40,360
-For you.

507
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:42,720
From Gardens Australia.

508
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:44,280
"Enjoy this selection of produce

509
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,760
"from one of our very own

510
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,760
community gardens."

511
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:49,520
I just think we might have

512
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:49,520
gone in a little half-cocked.

513
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:52,040
We announce half-cocked ideas

514
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:52,040
all the time!

515
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:54,320
-Is this a carrot?

516
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:54,320
-Uh, I think so.

517
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:56,640
-Why is it purple?

518
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:56,640
-It might be organic.

519
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:58,440
-Jim.

520
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:58,440
-What's the problem?

521
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,760
Uh, where to put it.

522
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,480
-What about here?

523
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,480
-That's a roundabout.

524
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:04,240
-What about here?

525
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:04,240
-It's a bit small.

526
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:05,840
It doesn't have to be big.

527
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:09,720
-We could use baby carrots,

528
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:09,720
micro herbs. -Jim.

529
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:12,360
Even those little bonsai

530
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:12,360
cucumbers. Problem solved.

531
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:14,720
-There is another problem.

532
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:14,720
-What's that?

533
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:17,080
The developer's refusing to have

534
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:17,080
it anywhere near his apartments.

535
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,520
Is that what he said?

536
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,120
His actual words were

537
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,120
"If you bleeping well

538
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:22,000
"try and put

539
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:22,000
a bleeping garden..."

540
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:23,560
-That's fine, Hugh.

541
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:23,560
-Alright, what about over here?

542
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,960
-That's a Costco. -There?

543
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,960
-Jim, please stop pointing.

544
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,920
-What's here?

545
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,920
-Unplanned zone.

546
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:30,200
-Let's plan it.

547
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:30,200
-It's years down the track.

548
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,120
We don't even know

549
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,120
what's going there.

550
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:34,480
-A community garden.

551
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:34,480
-For what community?

552
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:37,040
-This one.

553
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:37,040
-That's 3km away. -So?

554
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:39,040
The whole idea of

555
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:39,040
a community garden

556
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:40,840
is that it's

557
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:40,840
near the community.

558
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:43,640
They can get a shuttle bus.

559
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:43,640
A community shuttle bus!

560
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,720
Jim, it won't work.

561
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,160
Well, I was saving this.

562
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:50,480
But Jamie Oliver's people -

563
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:50,480
they wanna talk.

564
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:52,400
-Oh, wow.

565
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:52,400
-This thing's away.

566
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:54,880
-What about there?

567
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:54,880
-That's water. -Oh.

568
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:57,320
TONY: Sorry, Katie, am I gonna

569
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:57,320
have lunch with them as well?

570
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:59,200
No, but Mr Tseow

571
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:59,200
and his assistant,

572
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:01,400
Mr Tsiong, of the syndicate,

573
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:01,400
will drop by here.

574
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:02,800
-After the lunch.

575
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:02,800
-Yes.

576
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:04,560
And will there be

577
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:04,560
a translator?

578
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,440
'Cause last time, we stood

579
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,440
around nodding and smiling.

580
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,280
-It was kind of awkward.

581
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,280
-There'll be a translator.

582
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,600
-OK, fine. I'm going in now.

583
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,600
-Got it.

584
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:12,520
-Now, Karsten! Congratulations.

585
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:12,520
-Ah, Tony.

586
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,720
Thank you. Thank you.

587
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,720
Wait, you haven't seen it yet.

588
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:17,200
-Yeah, but it's done?

589
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:17,200
-Oh, yes, yes. Ready to go.

590
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:18,960
Special thanks

591
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:18,960
have to go to Scotty,

592
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,720
who has been

593
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,720
a great source of assistance.

594
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:23,360
-Where is Scotty?

595
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:23,360
-Gone to get more mood boards.

596
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:25,920
No, let's get this over with.

597
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:25,920
Let's knock it on the head.

598
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:27,560
Alright, well...

599
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,400
Before I reveal anything,

600
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:32,320
we didn't wanna get too far away

601
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:32,320
from the original logo.

602
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:34,440
No - wanted to make it

603
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:34,440
more of an evolution.

604
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,200
Exactly,

605
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,200
but I hope you agree

606
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,480
that all the elements

607
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,480
are still very much here.

608
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:40,000
I'll keep that in mind.

609
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:40,000
But let's...

610
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:41,920
-Tony?

611
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:41,920
-Yes.

612
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:43,960
Allied International Proprietary

613
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:43,960
Limited are on the phone.

614
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,480
-Yes, but I'll speak to them

615
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,480
in five minutes. -It's urgent.

616
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:48,800
Yes, but in five minutes,

617
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:48,800
I'll speak to them.

618
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:51,600
No time. It's really urgent.

619
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:56,800
I'll quickly speak to them.

620
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:58,360
No-one leave.

621
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:00,840
Allied International.

622
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:15,000
Why would you

623
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:15,000
wanna put it here?

624
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,720
It's not locked in.

625
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:18,520
We're just scoping out

626
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:18,520
some general possibilities.

627
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,640
-A community garden?

628
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,640
-Yes.

629
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:22,400
-Here?

630
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:22,400
-Yes!

631
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:24,440
But for what community?

632
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,800
Uh, the Woolarong

633
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,800
Urban Development.

634
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:29,280
-Way over there?

635
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:29,280
-There might be a shuttle bus.

636
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:31,200
But, surely,

637
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:31,200
if you're gonna...

638
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:33,480
Yeah, we just need to know

639
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:33,480
the sort of potential problems

640
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:36,440
that one might encounter

641
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:36,440
if we were to choose here.

642
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,160
-Here?

643
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,160
-Yes, Marni!

644
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:41,080
Sorry. I just need an overview.

645
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:44,960
-You got a pen?

646
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:44,960
-Yes.

647
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,200
Sorry about that, Karsten.

648
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,200
All good.

649
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:49,800
-That's alright. Take a seat.

650
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:49,800
-No, not this time. Reveal away.

651
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:51,600
-Scotty's not back yet.

652
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:51,600
-Yep. Let's go.

653
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:53,360
Will Allied International

654
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:53,360
call back?

655
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:55,360
-Let's go.

656
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:55,360
-OK.

657
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:01,360
-Bravo, maestro.

658
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:01,360
-Merci.

659
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:03,040
-Where's our name?

660
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:03,040
-Didn't need it.

661
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:04,760
-On a logo?

662
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:04,760
-Uh-uh.

663
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,640
-Not when you've got something

664
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,640
that strong. -Thank you.

665
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:09,240
I thought the whole point was

666
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:09,240
to tell people who we are.

667
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:10,440
Tell him, Karsten.

668
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:11,840
The more you write,

669
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:13,720
the more words and letters

670
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:13,720
that you use,

671
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:15,480
the less you actually say.

672
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:17,960
This way, the logo

673
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:17,960
does all the talking.

674
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,240
OK. And what is it saying

675
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,240
at the moment?

676
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:22,520
Listen to it. Yeah?

677
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:24,800
Might need someone

678
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:24,800
to speak on its behalf.

679
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:26,680
I'm gonna play you

680
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:26,680
the soundscape.

681
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:28,160
What?

682
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,120
-(ETHEREAL MUSIC PLAYS)

683
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,120
-It's saying...

684
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:32,520
One idea - nation-building -

685
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:35,080
through a prism -

686
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:35,080
your organisation -

687
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,200
endless possibilities.

688
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:39,760
Bam! I hear that.

689
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:39,760
Loud and clear.

690
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:42,480
Yeah, but at least

691
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:42,480
have our letters - NBA.

692
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:44,240
Aha!

693
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:47,960
N...B...A.

694
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,800
But I don't want people

695
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,800
playing 'Where's Wally?' with...

696
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:52,200
Could we just have

697
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:52,200
the soundscape off...

698
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:54,840
Actually, Karsten, can you just

699
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:54,840
give us five minutes alone here?

700
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:56,440
-Can do.

701
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:56,440
-Allied International...

702
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,040
Tell them

703
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,040
to stop calling, please.

704
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:00,040
OK? Thank you.

706
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:02,640
problem three or four?

707
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:04,000
Uh, four.

708
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:07,240
OK, so your gardens are in.

709
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:07,240
Who's gonna run 'em?

710
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:09,120
-Five.

711
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:09,120
-The residents?

712
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:11,200
The residents live in

713
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:11,200
another postcode.

714
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:13,320
-Who's gonna manage the place?

715
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:13,320
-Six.

716
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,160
-A manager?

717
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,160
-You need a committee.

718
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,960
You need constitution,

719
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,960
governance, rules.

720
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,440
-Sorry, slow down. Seven.

721
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,440
-So your garden's in.

722
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:21,280
What are you gonna do

723
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:21,280
about security?

724
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:22,760
I'll make this Part B.

725
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:25,520
-Sorry?

726
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:25,520
-How are you gonna protect it?

727
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:27,520
-Scarecrow?

728
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:27,520
-From people.

729
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:31,240
You know, pinching crops,

730
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:31,240
dumping rubbish, vandals.

731
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:33,280
You need fencing,

732
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:33,280
24-hour lighting.

733
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:36,520
We're running a garden, not

734
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:36,520
a witness protection scheme.

735
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:37,920
Just letting you know

736
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:37,920
the problems.

737
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:41,080
-And it's been very helpful.

738
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:41,080
-I'm not finished.

739
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:44,600
Do you understand

740
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:44,600
how a prism works?

741
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:47,000
Rhonda, I do.

742
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:47,000
I just don't like the logo.

743
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,720
-What don't you like about it?

744
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,720
-Everything.

745
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:50,320
The cost, the hassle,

746
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:50,320
the prismy thing.

747
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:52,080
Look, I've let you

748
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:52,080
had your play.

749
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:53,720
I don't think

750
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:53,720
it should be our logo.

751
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:55,680
-(SCOFFS) It's a bit late

752
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:55,680
to say that now. -What?

753
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:57,880
Karsten's logo's short-listed

754
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:57,880
for a National Design Award.

755
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,440
How?! He only just unveiled it.

756
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,880
Submitted a couple of weeks ago,

757
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,880
got the good news this morning.

758
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:05,480
-It's very exciting.

759
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:05,480
-What's it got to do with us?

760
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:08,080
Just the sort of heat we need.

761
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:08,080
There's a buzz now.

762
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:10,120
People wanna learn

763
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:10,120
"Who are the prism people?

764
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:11,960
"The people in the prism -

765
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:11,960
who are they?"

766
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,840
They certainly won't learn that

767
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,840
from the logo, Rhonda!

768
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:16,600
Really? People in the prism,

769
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:16,600
ideas come out.

770
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:18,160
We've finally got something

771
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:18,160
that's speaking

772
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:19,920
and you wanna go back

773
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:19,920
to the old logo.

774
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:22,600
It's not the old logo, it's the

775
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:22,600
current logo! It's on the wall!

776
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:24,480
I don't understand you.

777
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:24,480
I do not understand.

778
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:26,320
You know what?

779
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:26,320
Have your logo.

780
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:27,800
Rebrand everything.

781
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:27,800
I don't care.

782
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:29,880
I've got a huge deal

783
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:29,880
I'm trying...

784
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:32,760
As long as this is the last

785
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:32,760
I have to deal with it, fine.

786
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,480
-Fine.

787
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,480
-Fine.

788
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:35,960
OK - say we resolve

789
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,520
all the issues

790
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,520
you've mentioned.

791
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:39,320
Where you gonna park

792
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:39,320
the shuttle bus?

793
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,400
We'll find a place.

794
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,400
Assume it's resolved.

795
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:43,240
But after all that,

796
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:43,240
is there anything

797
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:45,600
to stop us

798
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:45,600
from putting a garden here?

799
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:48,080
-Guess not.

800
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:48,080
-Good.

801
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:50,760
Once you've tested the soil.

802
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:54,920
"Soil testing."

803
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,600
Amy, it's Tony.

804
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:07,480
-Hello, Tony.

805
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:07,480
-My swipe card's not working.

806
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:09,800
-Where are you?

807
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:09,800
-Here. At the door.

808
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:12,000
Oh! Oh, I'll let you in.

809
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:13,560
TONY: Thank you.

810
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:16,640
I don't know

811
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:16,640
what's wrong with it.

812
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:18,760
-We're getting new swipe cards.

813
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:18,760
-Why?

814
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:20,640
So they have

815
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:20,640
the new logo on them.

816
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:22,520
That is a tail wagging a dog.

817
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:24,480
-I thought it was

818
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:24,480
a triangle with a fan. -No.

821
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:29,200
They'll only be here a few days.

822
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:31,920
I knew this would happen. When

823
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:31,920
do we get the new swipe cards?

824
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:34,120
-As soon as you get

825
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:34,120
your photo taken. -(GROANS)

looking straight ahead,

829
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:37,280
not smiling.

830
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:38,920
TONY: I won't be.

831
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:48,760
Preliminary soil report.

832
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,360
And...good news?

833
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,800
-No.

834
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,800
-You're smiling.

835
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:54,760
Am I? I shouldn't be.

836
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:57,880
-TONY: Katie!

837
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:57,880
-KATIE: Yeah?

838
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:59,960
I can't retrieve my emails.

839
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:59,960
Is your email down?

840
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,920
-Yes, it is.

841
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,920
-Do you know why?

842
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:04,200
-Yes.

843
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:04,200
-Why?

844
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:06,480
We're offline for a few hours

845
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:06,480
while they update the website.

846
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:08,400
-What's wrong with it?

847
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:08,400
-Nothing.

848
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:10,960
-Then why are we updating it?

849
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:10,960
-'Cause it's got the old logo.

850
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,080
Oh, did you ring the Foreign

852
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:16,120
-No. When did he ring?

853
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:16,120
-I emailed you.

854
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,480
-Emails are down!

855
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,480
-(LAUGHS) Oh, yeah.

856
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:20,000
When you get it,

857
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:20,000
make sure you call,

858
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:21,480
'cause I marked it 'urgent'.

859
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:24,920
-I'll call him now.

860
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:24,920
-Oh, you need the number!

861
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,800
-Yes!

862
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,800
-Yes. OK. Uh...

HUGH: Yeah, I think there

867
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:36,240
used to be a factory there.

868
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:37,880
What did they make,

869
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:37,880
multivitamins?

870
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:39,240
No, I think it was batteries.

871
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:41,120
-What's 'Pb'?

872
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:41,120
-That'd be lead.

873
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:44,200
-Oh, is it? What's 'Cd'?

874
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:44,200
-Uh, cadmium.

875
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:46,000
-Oh, thank you.

876
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:46,000
-Yes, thank you.

877
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:48,320
-This can't be right.

878
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:48,320
-It's from the lab.

879
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:51,000
So, basically, we can't

880
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:51,000
grow vegetables in that soil.

881
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:53,080
You can.

882
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:53,080
You just can't eat them.

883
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:54,920
But that's the whole idea,

884
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:54,920
to eat them.

885
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,720
Then you have to

886
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,720
dig up the soil.

887
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:58,280
Can you imagine how expensive

888
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:58,280
that would be?

889
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:01,080
-Yeah.

890
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:01,080
-Hugh, you're smiling again.

00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:03,480

892
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:21,920

894
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:24,560
Oh, um...the paint.

00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:26,600
-Where is everyone? -Downstairs

896
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:26,600

And you've got that meeting

900
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:30,560
with Mr Tseow.

901
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:32,080

-It's the same meeting.

903
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:34,000
-Oh, that explains so much!

904
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:35,400
I need these new documents

905
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,160
formatted and printed

906
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,160

-We can't.

00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:41,000
-I thought we were back online.

911
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:43,040
We are, but the printer

912
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:43,040
needs to be reconfigured.

913
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:44,960
-What?

914
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:44,960
-Because of the new logo.

the significance of your sign.

954
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:26,480
-Oh, the logo?

955
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:26,480
-Logo?

956
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:28,480
Oh, yes, logo.

957
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:30,200
He wants to know

958
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:30,200
why there is

959
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:32,800
an explosion

960
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:32,800
coming out of the teepee

961
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:34,960
and is it a cannonball?

962
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,640
Oh, no, it's an idea going

963
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,640
through a prism - that's us -

964
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:40,320
and breaking into

965
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:40,320
many possibilities.

966
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:43,000
Ah. (TRANSLATES)

967
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,480
Oh. (SPEAKS CHINESE LANGUAGE)

968
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:52,080
Uh, he says that

969
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:52,080
he prefers the old one.

970
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:54,280
(LAUGHS) You know what?

971
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:54,280
I agree with him.

972
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:56,080
Anyway,

973
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:56,080
a very productive meeting,

974
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:58,600
and we'll keep you up to date

975
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:58,600
as the project firms up.

978
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,880
-TONY: Ah.

979
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,400
He says thank you

980
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:08,920
and he has been honoured

981
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:08,920
to have had your time.

982
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:11,280
Oh, very kind. Scotty,

983
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:11,280
have you got some of my cards?

984
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:14,480
Um, still waiting on

985
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:14,480
the printers with the new logo.

986
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:16,560
-OK. Some of the old cards?

987
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:16,560
-Thrown out.

988
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:20,760
-Grab the Post-it notes?

989
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:20,760
-Yes.

990
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:25,800
-Just 'Tony'. Number.

991
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:25,800
-'Tony'.

992
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:30,360
-Are you 6-1...

993
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:30,360
-1-6.

994
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:35,880
Thank you.

995
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,160
Very honoured.

996
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:40,240
-We'd have to excavate

997
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:40,240
the entire site. -Done.

998
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:41,920
-Then dispose of

999
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:41,920
the contaminated soil. -Done.

1000
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:43,760
Jim, have you thought

1001
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:43,760
of the cost?

1002
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:46,280
Have you thought of

1003
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:46,280
the blowback if we stop?

1004
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:48,520
All of that interest,

1005
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:48,520
all of those retweets -

1006
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:49,960
it'll just take one photo

1007
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,200
of Stephanie Alexander

1008
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,200
looking sullen

1009
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:54,560
and the tweet tide will turn.

1010
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:56,600
And you can forget about

1011
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:56,600
Jamie Oliver visiting.

1012
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:58,720
-Is Jamie Oliver visiting?

1013
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:58,720
-Teaming up with local youth.

1014
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:01,120
Gonna make a TV show

1015
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:01,120
where they open a cafe

1016
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:04,160
using only inner-city produce.

1017
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:06,240
Well, that's the other problem -

1018
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:06,240
even with site remediation,

1019
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:09,080
we can't guarantee anything will

1020
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:09,080
be safe for human consumption.

1021
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:11,160
They could end up

1022
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:11,160
having lead poisoning.

1023
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,720
-That takes years to show up.

1024
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,720
-Jim.

1025
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:16,360
It's an 8-week series.

1026

Jamie Oliver!

1027
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,600
-OK, here's one possibility.

1028
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,600
-Yes.

1029
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,680
Don't tweet.

1030
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,680
You haven't heard it.

1031
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:22,560
-Just a draft.

1032
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:22,560
-Mm.

1034
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:25,280
-We build the gardens. No.

1035

-Draft?

1036
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:26,920
-But... No.

1037
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:29,800
In stages.

1038
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:29,800
First stage - soil testing.

1039
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:32,080
-Haven't we already done that?

1040
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:32,080
-We need time.

1041
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:33,840
-Oh, yes.

1042
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:33,840
-More testing.

1043
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:36,120
Followed by a scoping study,

1044
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:38,800
maybe more testing.

1045
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:43,040
OK, and how long do you think

1046
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:43,040
all this might take?

1047
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:44,560
How long do you want?

1048
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:45,960
Couple of years.

1049
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,440
But we still say

1050
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,440
the garden's going in.

1051
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:51,040
Absolutely. I mean, we're just

1052
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:51,040
trying to get it right.

1053
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:52,960
But there could be some issues

1054
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:52,960
down the track.

1055
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,560
There's definitely

1056
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,560
going to be some issues.

1057
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:57,160
-A few blips.

1058
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:57,160
-I can say we're going ahead?

1059
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:58,520
There are

1060
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:58,520
some big names here.

1061
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:00,240
-Go for it.

1062
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:00,240
-Great.

1063
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:01,920
Slow-food movement

1064
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:01,920
will be happy.

1065
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:03,960
Couldn't get any slower!

1066

(KNOCK ON DOOR)

1067
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:13,840
-Morning, Amy.

1068
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:13,840
-Morning.

1069
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:15,600
I'm actually warming to it.

1070
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:17,680
-Mmm! All done.

1071
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:17,680
-Ah!

1072
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:19,240
And it works downstairs as well.

1073
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:20,840
Great. That's great. Well done.

1074
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,720
Oh, and Katie wanted

1075
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,720
to see you first thing.

1076
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:24,400
Ah! Beauty.

1077
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:27,000
-More good news? -Yeah.

1078
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:27,000
-Are they the cards? -Yep.

1079
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:28,560
Oh, they don't look that bad,

1080
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:28,560
actually.

1081
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:30,440
They're embossed -

1082
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:30,440
it was a little more expensive,

1083
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:32,160
but Rhonda felt

1084
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:32,160
it reflected us.

1085
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:34,640
Something about

1086
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:34,640
the trees and wood.

1087
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:36,840
Can you send a couple

1088
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:36,840
to Mr Tseow and his interpreter

1089
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,480
when we get the memorandums

1090
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,480
of understanding done?

1091
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:40,560
We need to get them done

1092
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:40,560
as soon as possible.

1093
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:43,080
-We've been asked to hold off

1094
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:43,080
on that. -Can't do that.

1095
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:45,000
-Just for a day or two.

1096
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:45,000
-Who asked? -Amy. -Amy?

1097
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:47,200
Well, not Amy.

1098
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:47,200
The legal department called...

1099
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:49,000
-What legal department?

1100
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:49,000
-Ours.

1101
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:50,960
-They just need

1102
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:50,960
to check something. -What?

1103
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,640
Something about it being

1104
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,640
too close to another logo.

1105
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:56,720
Oh, you're kidding me.

1106
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:58,440
Do you know a band

1107
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:58,440
named Pink Floyd?

1108
00:24:58,480 --> 00:24:59,760
(MUTTERS) Yes.

1109
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:02,480
They had an album,

1110
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:02,480
'Dark Side of the...Prism'?

1111
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:05,760
(MUTTERS) Yep.

1112
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:08,040
Is THAT something to do with

1113
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:08,040
the trees and the wood?

1114
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:15,560
I'll send the proper cards

1115
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:15,560
through

1116
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:18,040
when we get the teepee

1117
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:18,040
with the cann...the explos...

1118
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,920
..on the prism on the...

1119
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:21,880
When the new cards come through,

1120
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:21,880
we'll send them.

(TRANSLATES)

1122
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:25,640
-Are we still locked in?

1123
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:25,640
-Yes.

1124
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:27,920
-OK. Where are the painters?

1125
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:27,920
-They went to lunch.

1126
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:30,520
OK.

1127
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:32,040
Would you like

1128
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:32,040
a Post-it note?

1129
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:33,360
Oh, please. Please.

1130
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:35,240
'Tony'. Same again. 'Tony'.

1131
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:37,120
-1-6.

1132
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:37,120
-1-6.

1133
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:39,520
Would you like email?

1134
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:42,080
No, just the call,

1135
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:42,080
I think, will be better.

1136
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:46,440
Thank you.

1137
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:49,400
And, sir, in the back.

1138
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:49,400
One for you?

1139
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:57,280
-Sorry, 1-6.

1140
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:57,280
