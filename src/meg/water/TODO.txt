Open questions:
- Where to place mains flow meter? Wireless/Power/Water - does later branch off before house? Maybe cut through driway, repair and put a water barrier/drain in place?
- Where to place front sprinkler controller? Wireless/Power proximity to Solenoids/Water

Water:
# Main flow/volume (at source 17m from meter box or downstream close to house)
# House flow/volume (under landing)
# Garden flow/volume (calculated)
# Automated fast leak detection
# Slow Leak detection process for house/garden/all
