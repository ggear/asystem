#
# BACKUP_MODULE_NAME      this module's name
# BACKUP_SOURCE_PATH      this module's source data path
# BACKUP_SOURCE_VERSION   the version the backup was extracted from
# BACKUP_TARGET_PATH      this run's backup path, empty until backup_target names it
# BACKUP_RUN_TIMESTAMP    this run's timestamp, shared by the directory and the filename
# BACKUP_FULL_SUFFIX      the file suffix marking a full backup
# BACKUP_DELTA_SUFFIX     the file suffix marking a delta backup, requiring a full backup proceeding it
# BACKUP_RETAIN_DAYS      the window by which daily backups are retained before entering the pruning window
# BACKUP_SKIP_HOURS       skip the run when the newest backup is younger than this
