# TODO:
- Import historic weather data (high/low/rain) to influxDB (monthly), ticked every 1 minutes from last tick in database to current time from BOM (rain divided by days in month).
- Do the same for historic actuals for corresponding measures (daily), and also for aggregates (monthly).
- Display on same high/low graph daily view on stepped chart showing the discrepancies.
- For rain, show daily (averages) and monthly (cumulative).
