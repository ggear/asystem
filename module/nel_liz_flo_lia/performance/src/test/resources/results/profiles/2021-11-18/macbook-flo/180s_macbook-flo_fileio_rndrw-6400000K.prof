sysbench 1.0:  multi-threaded system evaluation benchmark

Running the test with following options:
Number of threads: 1
Initializing random number generator from current time


Extra file open flags: 0
20 files, 312.5MiB each
6.1035GiB total file size
Block size 32KiB
Number of IO requests: 10000
Read/Write ratio for combined random IO test: 1.50
Periodic FSYNC enabled, calling fsync() each 100 requests.
Calling fsync() at the end of test, Enabled.
