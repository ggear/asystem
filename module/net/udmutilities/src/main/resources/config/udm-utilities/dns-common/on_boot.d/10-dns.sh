# As above, this should match the gateway of the VLAN for the container

# if you want IPv6 support, generate a ULA, select an IP for the dns server
# and an appropriate gateway address on the same /64 network. Make sure that
# the 20-dns.conflist is updated appropriately. It will need the IP and GW
# added along with a ::/0 route. Also make sure that additional --dns options
# are passed to podman with your IPv6 DNS IPs when deploying the container for
# the first time. You will also need to configure your VLAN to have a static
# IPv6 block.

# IPv6 Also works with Prefix Delegation from your provider. The gateway is the
# IP of br(VLAN) and you can pick any ip address within that subnet that dhcpv6
# isn't serving
