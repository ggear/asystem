Running the test with following options:
Number of threads: 1
Initializing random number generator from current time


Extra file open flags: 0
20 files, 312.5MiB each

Number of IO requests: 10000
Read/Write ratio for combined random IO test: 1.50
Periodic FSYNC enabled, calling fsync() each 100 requests.
Calling fsync() at the end of test, Enabled.
